# AMATH 482 Projects
This repository contains reports on solutions to a variety of applied problems using Matlab and Python

## Tracking a Marble from Ultrasound Data
Given noisy ultrasound data, this problem looks to denoise the data, enabling tracking a marble lost in the stomach of a dog. The solution draws on the Fourier Transform and Gaussian Filters.

## Time-Frequency Analysis on Music Clips
This problem looks to filter music signals in order to determine the notes being played and when they are played with the goal of recreating the music score for the various songs. The Gabor Transform is used in addition to the Fourier Transform and Gaussian Filters.

## Principal Component Analysis of Paint Can Motion
